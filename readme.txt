Abalone Game GUI
	- About: Displays the game itself. Includes the game board, starting page and configurations page. The main page
	also includes the display of players' stats, suggested next move generated by AI, and next move input for human
	player.

	- To Run: Run main.py and click [Start] button to have the game board and marbles generated.
	
State Space Generator
	- About: This generator intakes a given state of the board (Test<#>.input) and the which players' turn to move and
	uses that data to generate all the possible legal moves on the board for that player and their resulting board
	state.

	- To Run: Run the main() inside the StateSpaceGenerator (state_space_generator.py) and you will be prompted to
	enter the Test<#>.input file name in console without the extension. The moves taken and their resulting board state
	will be outputted into Test<#>.move and Test<#>.board.

Game-Playing Agent:
    - About: This game-playing agent intakes an input list that contains which player's it is (either 'b' or 'w')
    and the current board state. It uses the current board state to generate a tree of all possible resulting board
    states. From those board states the agent further extends the tree by generating the opponent's responses. The
    current tree searches a depth of 2. The heuristic evaluation function is then applied to these board states to
    assign a score. We use minimax by max of opponent's scores and then by min of those to select the agent's next
    best move. A quiescent search is applied when there's a move that pushes the opponent's marbles off the board
    and searches for the next nonquiescent position and its score.

    - To Run the Game-Playing Agent on it's own: Run the main() (uncomment it) inside the GamePlayingAgent class
    (game_playing_agent.py) and the agent will play against another agent. Each player's responses will be outputted
    as move notations.
    - To Run the Game-Playing Agent in the Abalone GUI: when Black Player is selected as the Computer the agent will
    start the game by playing a random legal move.
